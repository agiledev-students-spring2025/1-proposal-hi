# Project Proposal

## Project Title

Memory map

## What and Why?

An app that lets users pin memories to specific locations, creating a digital map of personal experiences. Users can attach meaningful messages or photos to places they've visited, whether it's a special moment shared with a loved one or a solo adventure. For example, a user could mark a spot with a message like, "I crocheted a bag here with my grandma on June 29th, 2024." Sometimes, memories fade with time, but this app will allow users to feel like they were back on that day again.

## For who?

Anyone! This app is meant for anyone who wants to preserve their memories and relive special moments.

## How?

The user would be able to create memories tied to specific locations. After pinning a location on the map, the user can integrate messages, photos or even audio that relate to the location. They can also search and filter for memories, in case they ever need to be reminded of them again. There will be push notifications for important dates marked by the user, or if a user walks close to a memory. This platform will serve as a digital memory book.

## Scope

This app might require location information and an interactive map, but they can be possibly be retrieved from google maps. The programmers may just need to work on recording, managing and showing memories.
